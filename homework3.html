<h1>Accessibility Testing on Jefferson County Public Library</h1>

<p>Name: Jessica Rothman
<br>Class Project: Accessibility Testing
<br>Website: https://jeffcolibrary.org
<br>Date: Jan. 29, 2023</p>

<p>The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">W3C WAI Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility.</a></p>

<p><h2>Website Page Title</h2></p>
<p>In the web page markup, the < title > is within the < head > tag. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation, they help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser tab. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>
<p>Result: Good. Most pages had clear, descriptive HTML title values that included the main website title. However, for pages with multiple headings, it is noted that the title only describes the overall subpage. For example, when clicking the "Book a Librarian" link (which is part of the "Contact Us" page) the title reads "Contact Us" but does not let the reader know that they are at the section of the page that allows you to book a librarian.</p>

<p><h2>Image Text Alternatives</h2></p>
<p>Image text alternatives ("alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.) Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image.</p>
<p>Results: Lacking. Multiple pages on the site have linked images with no alt text. It is recommended for all images to have descriptive alt text.</p>

<p><h2>Text:</h2></p>
