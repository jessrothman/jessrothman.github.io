<h1>Accessibility Testing on Jefferson County Public Library</h1>

<p>Name: Jessica Rothman
<br>Class Project: Accessibility Testing
<br>Website: https://jeffcolibrary.org
<br>Date: Jan. 29, 2023</p>

<p>The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">W3C WAI Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility.</a></p>

<p><h2>Website Page Title</h2></p>
<p>In the web page markup, the < title > is within the < head > tag. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation, they help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser tab. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>
<p>Results: Good. Most pages had clear, descriptive HTML title values that included the main website title. However, for pages with multiple headings, it is noted that the title only describes the overall subpage. For example, when clicking the "Book a Librarian" link (which is part of the "Contact Us" page) the title reads "Contact Us" but does not let the reader know that they are at the section of the page that allows you to book a librarian.</p>

<p><h2>Image Text Alternatives</h2></p>
<p>Image text alternatives ("alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.) Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image.</p>
<p>Results: Lacking. Multiple pages on the site have images with no alt text. It is recommended for all images to have descriptive alt text for ease-of-use with screen readers, especially linked images, to allow the reader to know where they navigate to.</p>

<p><h2>Text:</h2></p>
<p>Headings, Contrast Ratio ("color contrast") and Resizing Text should not only support visual aesthetics but also support the navigation and visibility of text content.</p>
<p>Headings Results: Good. Some pages were missing an &lt;h1&gt; element, but still maintained a meaningful hierarchy amongst the headings that were there.
<p>Contrast Ratio Results: Excellent. This webpage has a contrast ratio of 8:59:1 and mostly utilizes a white background with black text, or, if using a color background, it is dark with white text.</p>
<p>Resizing Text Results: Fair. All text does enlarge when you zoom, but requires horizontal scrolling to view all of it. It is recommended for text to shift to a "mobile-friendly" view when magnified for ease of reading.</p>

<p><h2>Interaction:</h2></p>
<p>Keyboard access and visual focus Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on a keyboard to interact with web pages. Keyboard focus should be visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight.</p>
<p>Results: Excellent. Pages and submenus were easily navigable using keyboard commands.</p>
<p>Forms, labels, and errors (including Search fields)</p>
<p>Results: Excellent. Tested the search bar using only keyboard commands and was able to seamlessly perform a search.</p>

<p><h2>General:</h2></p>
<p>Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content</p>
<p>Results: Excellent. There are multiple moving carousels on the throughout the site that are easily navigable using the keyboard.</p>
<p>Multimedia (video, audio) closed captions and transcripts</p>
<p>Results: Excellent. All videos present on site included non-automated closed captioning.</p>
<p>Basic Structure Check: It helps you understand how some people "see" the web page differently. For this basic structure check, you look at the web page without images, styles, and layout. Web pages are often designed with multiple columns, sections, colors, and other visual aspects that help organize information for people who see the page in its default display. However, some people do not see the page this way.</p>
<p>Results: Excellent. WAVE was used to remove CSS styling on the library's home page. The home page contains a large amount of information in its header, but conveniently places links at the top for someone using a screen reader to skip to different navigation menus.</p>

<p><h2>In Summary:</h2></p>
<p>Overall, the Jefferson County Public Library website scored well in most accessibility categories. There are still areas for improvement, but it is nice to see the effort put into making a truly accessible website. Below are some resources that can be used to address the shortcomings brought up in this report.</p>
